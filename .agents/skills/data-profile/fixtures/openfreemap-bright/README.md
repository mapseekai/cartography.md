# OpenFreeMap bright Skill fixture

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This directory contains non-normative test data for the `data-profile` Skill. It
is not a core cartography.md example, a `CARTOGRAPHY.md` contract, or a profile
that has passed core validation.

The fixture uses the public [OpenFreeMap "bright"](https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/bright)
style, a production OpenMapTiles basemap. The integration test reads the local
style only: it does not fetch TileJSON, vector tiles, fonts, or sprites, and it
does not require live network access.

## Deterministic profile

`DATA_PROFILE.json` is the fixed-timestamp output of style discovery:

```bash
pnpm --filter @cartographymd/data-profile-skill profile -- \
  --style fixtures/openfreemap-bright/style.json \
  --observed-at 2026-08-29T00:00:00Z \
  --output fixtures/openfreemap-bright/DATA_PROFILE.json
```

Run the command from `.agents/skills/data-profile`. Because the run observes
only the style, its evidence is `style-inferred`; field domains and actual tile
contents remain explicit unresolved items. The committed output is an expected
test fixture, not an assertion that it completely describes OpenMapTiles data.

## Files

- `style.json` — the locally retained OpenFreeMap bright style used as discovery input;
- `DATA_PROFILE.json` — deterministic expected output used by `tests/openfreemap.test.ts`;
- `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.zh-CN.md` — colocated license and attribution notices for the retained style.

Rendering the style itself still requires network access to
`tiles.openfreemap.org` for tiles, fonts, and sprites; the fixture test never
renders it.
