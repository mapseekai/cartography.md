## Overview

Quiet Atlas is a restrained editorial map family: warm paper, pale blue water,
and near-black ink make the page feel calmly printed rather than brightly
screen-lit. It favors pauses, generous margins, and a small set of durable
signals that let a reader settle into an unfamiliar place.

## Colors

Use {colors.paper} as the low-glare canvas and {colors.water} as its cool,
quiet counterweight. {colors.building} holds built texture a
half-step above the canvas. {colors.road-warm} and {colors.road-amber} are
related, sparing navigation accents; {colors.ink} anchors essential names and
decisive editorial marks rather than broad decoration. Aim for WCAG 2.2 contrast of at
least 4.5:1 for ordinary critical text and 3:1 for large text or essential
non-text marks against their effective backgrounds. Preserve meaning with
weight, outline, dash, symbol, or placement as well as hue.

## Typography & Labels

Typography is measured, literate, and quietly contemporary. Use
{typography.label-primary} for the few names that guide orientation, and
{typography.label-context} for supporting place reading. Favor fewer,
well-placed names with {spacing.label-gap} of breathing room,
and keep {spacing.symbol-label-gap} between a point symbol and its label;
protect critical labels with the quiet halo in `place-label-primary`, never a
visible badge.

## Composition & Density

Compose from calm paper through contextual water and built texture to routes
and names. Protect open paper around important labels and across broad calm
areas. When density rises, reduce secondary texture and labels before crowding
the focal marks; breathing room is information design, not unused space.

## Layering & Depth

The conceptual order is paper ground, context, subject, then annotation.
`paper-ground` stays flat; `water-area`, `waterway-line`, and `road-secondary`
recede through lighter color and {opacities.context}. `road-primary` and `place-label-primary`
hold {opacities.solid} and emerge through weight, casing, and contrast without
making the map theatrical.

## Geometry & Symbols

Favor slender, deliberate linework; soft low-contrast areas; and compact marks
with unambiguous silhouettes. Point marks step from {sizes.point-small} to
{sizes.point-medium} only when a place truly earns the extra weight.
`administrative-boundary` uses {dashes.boundary} only for reference separation.
Curves should read as calm gestures rather than technical traces; remove
details that cannot retain their family resemblance at small sizes.

## Scale & Generalization

At `overview`, preserve the large spatial story and only the strongest names.
At `regional`, establish major water and route relationships. At `local`, reveal
supporting routes and contextual labels; at `detail`, add compact reference
marks selectively. Each stage simplifies before it shrinks and remains the same
printed atlas rather than a different visual system.

## Map Elements

`paper-ground` establishes the warm canvas. `water-area` and `waterway-line`
form the quiet water family, while `road-primary` and `road-secondary` express
one route family at different roles. `administrative-boundary` is a subdued
reference line. `place-label-primary` and `place-label-context` use the place
label family to separate orientation from context. `atlas-point` supplies a
compact, inked reference mark. These are visual components, not bindings to
specific datasets, fields, or rendering layers.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do preserve the paper-water-ink relationship and spend warm accents sparingly.
Do use related family, role, and state values when adding a persistent variant.
Do retain a second visual channel for important distinctions. Don't fill every
empty area with texture or labels. Don't use decorative color, heavy outlines,
or competing type voices to manufacture energy. Don't turn a temporary state
into a louder hierarchy than the subject it represents.
